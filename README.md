## Introduction

- I wanted to experience various backend and frontend technologies and see the differences between them.

- I am going to make projects with same concepts and see how they work out with different technologies.

- Started with [this](https://github.com/dedeogluhu/poll-app-v01) one with express using pug and sass engines but abandoned it due to reasons shown in that repository.
    
- I am using Html, Css, Javascript, Expressjs and MongoDB in this version. 

## Getting Started

#### Prepare the project
